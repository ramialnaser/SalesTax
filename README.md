*Problem 1: SALES TAXES
Basic sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books, food, and medical
products that are exempt. Import duty is an additional sales tax
applicable on all imported goods at a rate of 5%, with no exemptions. When I purchase items
I receive a receipt which lists the name of all the items and their price (including tax),
finishing with the total cost of the items,
and the total amounts of sales taxes paid. The rounding rules for sales tax are that for a tax
rate of n%, a shelf price of p contains (np/100 rounded up to the nearest 0.05) amount of
sales tax.
Write an application that prints out the receipt details for these shopping basketsâ€¦

INPUT FILES must be clone with the project or in the root of project directory.

Input Files are :Input 1.txt
                 Input 2.txt
                 Input 3.txt


Program Flow:

The Main method extend Application class to use JavaFx functionality and run the user GUI.
receiptController Class will handel the communication between the GUI and backend code, 
and it will create Product objects based on the information that provided by the input files.
Moreover, calculating the receipt by neither multiplying by 10% or 5%.
